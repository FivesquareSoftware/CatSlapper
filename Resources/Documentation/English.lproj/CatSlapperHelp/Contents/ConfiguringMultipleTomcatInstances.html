		<p class="topicHeading">Configuring Multiple Tomcat Instances</p>
		<p>
		It is possible to have multiple instance of multiple versions of Tomcat running on a single Mac OS X machine.
		This is often necessary when developing Java Web applications for deployment to various servers and target JDKs.
		CatSlapper makes it simple by capturing the necessary information to uniquely control an instance of Tomcat 
		in each configuration you create. 
		</p>
		<p>
		The factors that make an instance of Tomcat unique from other instances are as follows:
		</p>
		<div class="taskBox">
			<ul>
				<li>The value of the environment variable CATALINA_HOME. This indicates where the Tomcat binaries
				are installed.</li>
				<li>If two instances share the same value for CATALINA_HOME, the the value of CATALINA_BASE 
				can differentiate them. CATALINA_BASE indicates where resources for a running instance are stored, 
				such as logs, libraries and deployed Web applications.  When CATALINA_BASE is different from
				CATALINA_HOME, Tomcat binaries are loaded from CATALINA_HOME and can be shared. If CATALINA_BASE
				is not set it defaults to the value of CATALINA_HOME.</li>
			</ul>
					</div>

		<p>
		As long as these environmental conditions are met, an instance of Tomcat can be uniquely controlled.  
		This is true whether you are using CatSlapper to manage your Tomcats or not.  CatSlapper can make 
		it easier to correctly configure your Tomcats by warning you of conflicts or misconfigurations that 
		may cause unexpected results when stopping, starting or performing other management tasks on a Tomcat 
		instance.
		</p>
		<div class="taskBox">
			<p>Click the grey information button that appears next to the read text "Configuration Errors"
			to see why a Tomcat instance does not validate.
			</p>
					</div>
		<p>
		While not strictly part of a unique Tomcat instance configuration, setting up which ports Tomcat
		listens on for requests over various protocols (such as HTTP or AJP), is crucially important. This
		is because only one Tomcat can listen on a given port at any one time. Currently, CatSlapper
		does not manage these port settings for you, except when you use it to install a Tomcat instance 
		in the first place.  <!-- It will, however, warn you when a port conflict exists. -->
		</p>
		<p>
		Connector port settings settings are managed in the server.xml file for each installation of Tomcat.  
		You can read more about it on the 
<?php include("Include/tomcat_website.inc.html") ?>.
		If you have Tomcat running in CatSlapper already, you can also click "Help" in the main menu and select
		"Local Tomcat Documentation" to read the Tomcat documentation installed on your machine.
