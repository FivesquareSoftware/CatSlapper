		The Tomcat Manager application is capable of deploying Web applications to a particular
		host configured on a Tomcat instance. It can do this by either deploying an application
		residing on the same machine as itself, or by receiving a WAR file in an upload along with
		the command to deploy.
		</p>
		<p>
		To start the deployment process, select "Deploy webapp" from the commands popop menu
		for a host component.
