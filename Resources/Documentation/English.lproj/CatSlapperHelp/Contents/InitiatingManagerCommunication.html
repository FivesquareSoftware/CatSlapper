            NOTE: All uses of the Tomcat Manager application require that authentication for that instance
            be configured.  CatSlapper does not currently do this for you. To learn more about configuring
            the Tomcat Manager application for authentication see the 
<?php include("Include/tomcat_website.inc.html") ?>.
            </p>
            		</div>
		
		<p>
		When a configuration is first added, and CatSlapper has yet to retrieve any component
		information from Tomcat Manager, you will see just the root element&mdash;the current instance of
		Tomcat. CatSlapper ships set to perform automatic updates of component information at regular 
		intervals. However, you can initiate the communication manually if you wish.
