		<p class="topicHeading">Installing A Tomcat Instance</p>
		<p>
		CatSlapper simplifies the installation of Tomcat instances.  It can currently install Tomcat 5.0.28, while
		configuring the minimal settings that are needed to run a Tomcat instance for you.
		</p>
		<div class="taskBox">
			<ol>
				<li>Select Action > Install from the main menu or click on "Install" in the toolbar.</li>
				<li>Provide at least a name, and values for JAVA_HOME and CATALINA_HOME (these are required
				by Tomcat to start).</li>
				<li>Click the "Install" button (or further configure Tomcat as noted below).</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<p>
		At this point you will have installed a minimally configured Tomcat instance. If
		you want to further customize this instance of Tomcat, do some or all of the following 
		before you click "Install".
		</p>
		<div class="taskBox">
			<ol>
				<li>Enter values for which ports you want this instance of Tomcat to listen on for
				HTTP requests, and requests from Web server connectors (like mod_jk) that use the AJP protocol.
				The existing values are the defaults that Tomcat uses.  Only one instance of Tomcat can listen
				on a given port at a time, so make sure these values don't conflict with other Tomcats.</li>
				<li>Enable or disable a StartupItem for this Tomcat instance as you wish.</li>
				<li>If you know how to use CATALINA_BASE and CATALINA_OPTS, enter your desired values.</li>
				<li>Click the "Install" button.</li>
			</ol>
