		<p class="topicHeading">Managing Tomcat Components</p>
		<p>
		Tomcat ships with some default Web applications, among these the "Manager" application.  Tomcat Manager
		allows administrators to perform management tasks on Tomcat components and gather 
		information about deployed Web applications, the system and Tomcat itself using a Web browser.
		</p>
		<p>
		In order to simplfy the use of the Tomcat Manager application and consolidate its core capabilities
		into a single interface, CatSlapper utilizes a number of Tomcat Manager's programmatic
		interfaces, including its 
		<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/JavaManagement/" target="_blank">JMX (Java Management Extensions)</a> 
		proxy servlet, which uses JMX beans to gather information about and control various components 
		within Tomcat. CatSlapper displays this component information and provides controls for common tasks
		you might wish to perform in its "Components" view.
		</p>
		<p>
		Use the links below to get detailed information and instructions on how to use 
		CatSlapper's "Components" view.
