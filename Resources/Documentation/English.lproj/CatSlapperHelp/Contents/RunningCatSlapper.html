		<p>
			CatSlapper is a tool that helps Java Developers and System Administrators to manage multiple 
			Jakarta Tomcat instances.  In order to use CatSlapper a number of requirements must be met:
		</p>
		<div class="taskBox">
			<ol>
				<li>You must be using Mac OS X Tiger (10.4) or higher</li>
				<li>While not strictly a CatSlapper requirement, a Java Development Kit must be installed
					to compile JSPs</li>
				<li>You must have administrator privileges on the computer where CatSlapper is installed
					if you plan on using certain features, like managing launchd jobs to run
					Tomcat at system boot.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<p>
			When you first start CatSlapper, it will pick up any running Tomcat instances and add them to it's database.
			However, CatSlapper currently only supports Tomcat 5.0.x. Changes from version to version of Tomcat
			may make older or newer Tomcats behave erratically when controlled by CatSlapper. Do not rely on CatSlapper 
			to manage unsupported versions of Tomcat in production environments.
