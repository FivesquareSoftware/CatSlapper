		<p>
		CatSlapper allows you to decide whether to run each Tomcat instance
		as either your own user or as the super user, root.
		</p>
		<p>
		Which you choose depends on your requirements for Tomcat.  If you are
		a Java developer running Tomcat on your workstation, you will most 
		likely want to use the default and run Tomcat as your own user.
		System adminstrators using CatSlapper on a production machine, might
		want to run Tomcat as root.
		</p>

		<div class="taskBox">
			<p class="taskDirection">
			To enable or disable privileged operation for a Tomcat Instance:
			</p>
			<p>
			Check or uncheck "Run Privileged" in a Tomcat's configuration.

		Repairing Permissions
		</p>
		<p>
		When a Tomcat instance is run initially as root, it may create files 
		and other resources (like sockets) that can not be subsequently
		controlled by an ordinary user.  To help you out if this situation
		occurs, CatSlapper can repair the permission on a Tomcat instance
		that you have converted from a privileged Tomcat to a non-privileged
		Tomcat.
		</p>
				
		<div class="taskBox">
			<p class="taskDirection">
			To allow CatSlapper to repair permissions on a Tomcat:
			</p>
			<ol>
			<li>Click "OK" when CatSlapper alerts you of a permissions problem
			and asks to repair it.
			</li>
			<li>Enter an administrator's credentials at the prompt.</li>
