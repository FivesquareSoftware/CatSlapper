		<p>
		By far the biggest problem that arises when first trying out Tomcat is that it won't start.
		There are really only a few reasons why this could be.
		</p>
		<ul>		
			<li>Required environment variables are not set&mdash;make sure JAVA_HOME and CATALINA_HOME are
			set in your environment if you are starting Tomcat from a shell.  If you are using CatSlapper
			this is taken care of for you, so as long as you don't see any configuration errors in
			the main controller window in the "Server" tab, this isn't the problem.</li>
			<li>The ports Tomcat's connectors are trying to listen on are already in use&mdash;have a look
			in $CATALINA_HOME/conf/server.xml and look for the ports being used by the http and ajp connectors.
			Make sure they don't conflict with any ports other services are using on your machine.</li>
			<li>You are using an unsupported JDK&mdash;different versions of Tomcat support different
			versions of the JDK.  Make sure you are using the correct JDK for a particular version of Tomcat.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		More information about what's going wrong is always available in Tomcat's logs.  CatSlapper 
		displays the output from the server instance in its console view.  You can always look at the logs
		in $CATALINA_HOME/logs.
