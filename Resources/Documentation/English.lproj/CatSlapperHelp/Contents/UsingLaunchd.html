		<p class="topicHeading">Launching Tomcat Instances at Startup or Login</p>
		<p>
		CatSlapper can help you interface with launchd, Apple's new replacement for
		StartupItems, to create a variety of startup events for your Tomcat instances.
		See 'man launchd' for more information about launchd.
		</p>
		<p>
		There are two kinds of startup events currently supported: system boot and 
		user login.  The first are referred to as LaunchDaemons, while the second
		are called LaunchAgents. Additionally, you can run a Tomcat started at system 
		boot as either your own user or the privileged user (root). LaunchAgents
		always run as your user.
		</p>

		<div class="taskBox">
			<p class="taskDirection">
			To enable or disable a startup event for a Tomcat Instance:
			</p>
			<p>
			Select your desired event from the "Startup Automatically" dropdown.
			</p>
		</div>

		<p class="taskHeading">
		ACLs are Required to use LaunchDaemons
		</p>
		
		<a name="CatSlapper_ACLs"></a>
		<p>
		In order to enable LaunchDaemons, you must be able to write to /Library/LaunchDaemons
		as an administrator. To facilitate this, and so you are not asked
		for your administrator's password each time there is a change to a LaunchDaemon
		(which can be frequent because changes in the Tomcat configuration must be written
		back to the LaunchDaemon configuration), CatSlapper uses Access Control Lists (ACLs). 
		</p>
		<p>
		ACLs are a new feature in Mac OS X Tiger, but they are not enabled by default.
		So, the first time you select "When System Starts" from the automatic startup 
		dropdown, CatSlapper checks if you have enabled ACLs, and if not, asks 
		you to let it do so. You can choose not to let CatSlapper do this, but you 
		will not be able to enable a LaunchDaemon from within CatSlapper after this 
		point.
		</p>
		<p>
		If you change your mind later, you can edit CatSlapper's preferences to let 
		it enable ACLs. Additionally, unless you've told it not to, CatSlapper will 
		keep asking you to enable ACLs if it sees that they're necssary.
		</p>
		
		<div class="taskBox">
			<p class="taskDirection">
			To enable ACLs from CatSlapper's preferences:
			</p>
			<p>
			Check "OK to use Access Control lists" in CatSlapper's General preferce pane.
			</p>
		</div>
		
		<p>
		If you do grant CatSlapper permission to use ACLs, it will enable them for your 
		root volume if need be, and add an ACL entry to /Library/LaunchDaemons allowing 
		just your user to write and delete. You could simulate these two operations
		by executing roughly the following two commands in Terminal:<br/>
		<pre>
	[Your-Computer] % sudo fsaclctl -p / -e
	[Your-Computer] % sudo chmod +a "<i>user</i> allow add_file,delete_child" LaunchDaemons
		</pre>
		where <i>user</i> is replaced with your user name.
		</p>
		<p>
		It is important to understand that there are security implications to adding 
		this rule: if someone were to gain access to your machine as your user they
		could enable a malicious LaunchDaemon without your knowledge. Of course, if
		someone actually did gain this access, there are few limits to what else they 
		could do, so, adding this rule does not inherently make your machine less
		secure.  The lesson: guard your administrator's account carefully.
		</p>
